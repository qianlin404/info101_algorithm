### Introduction to Algorithms

What are algorithms and why we use them? Recall the definition to we made in class, an algorithm is simply a step-by-step process where each step must be followed precisely and be carried out in a prescribed order ending in a finite result. In other word, an algorithm is just a method we use to yield promised results and solve problems including but not limited to: 

* Sorting
* Searching
* Pattern Recognizing 
* Optimization
* …

But why we want to use algorithms, or why we prefer one algorithm over another? Well, the short answer is we want to get better results with using less time and resources. For example, you don’t want to wait minutes just for loading a webpage. And you don’t want to run out of all your computer memory just for classifying an image. Thus, different algorithms are often compared in terms of quality of results (e.g. accuracy) and resources consumed (e.g. time, memory). In this article, we will describe introductory sorting and searching algorithms and compares their performance. 


### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/qianlin404/info101_algorithm/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
